## Before you proceed
Thank you for reporting a bug. To ensure we have sufficient information about your issue, please use the following sections as a template and fill in your information. Please note that general questions may have been answered already so it would be worth investigating closed issues before posting a new one.

Please also note that we are not managing:
  - the ascatNgs tool, hosted and maintained in another GitHub repo so bugs should be reported here: https://github.com/cancerit/ascatNgs.
  - the ASCAT versions part of external sources (e.g. Conda, Sarek, etc.). Such versions may be outdated so please only report issues related to the most recent ASCAT release, installed as recommended.

## Describe the bug
Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## To Reproduce
Please provide the following:
  - `sessionInfo()`
  - All R commands/scripts
  - All log information (both stderr and stdout)
  - All ASCAT plots

If possible, please also provide input data (e.g. counts, log/BAF, etc.) so we have a minimal reproducible example we can use on our side.

## Additional information
Please provide any other useful information here.
